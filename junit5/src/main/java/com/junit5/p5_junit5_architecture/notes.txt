--Junit 4 and Junit5 are completely different.
--Junit 4 was a monolitic framework, while Junit 5 is a modular framework.
That means Junit4 was a single jar file, while Junit5 is a set of jar files.
So on microservice environment, you can use only the jars you need. That means boot time is faster.

--Junit 5 has platform and on top of it there are 2 modules - Junit Jupiter and Junit Vintage (older version of junit tests when you run).
--Jupiter is  the new programming model and Vintage is for backward compatibility. That's why Junit5 and Junit4 are different completely. Junit5 supports Junit4 tests as well.

--Developer will not get in touch with platform directly, instead he will use Jupiter API to write tests.
