When a Java application starts one process will be created.
Process is the living version of a program. (Program is not executed but process is and loaded into ram).
Process can contain multiple thread. It has some threads running background like GarbageCollector.
But it is single threaded by default for programmer. Programmer can create multiple threads optionally.
Default one is the Application Thread where the main method stands.
